# Weather-App
This weather application is built using JavaScript and integrated with a weather API to provide real-time weather information. The app predicts the current weather for the user's location and allows users to search for weather conditions anywhere in the world. Along with the temperature, it displays key weather metrics such as humidity, wind speed, and cloudiness, making it a comprehensive tool for quick weather updates.

**Features**
1. Current Location Weather: Automatically detects and displays the weather conditions of the user's current location.
2. Search Functionality: Allows users to search for the weather of any city or place globally.
3. Detailed Weather Information: Provides temperature, humidity, wind speed, and cloudiness for any location.
4. Responsive Design: The application is designed to work on various screen sizes, with styling done using CSS for a clean, user-friendly interface.

**How It Works**
The app fetches real-time weather data using a weather API (such as OpenWeatherMap or WeatherAPI). When a user opens the app, it utilizes the browser's geolocation API to retrieve the user's current coordinates and then makes a request to the weather API to fetch the weather information for that location. Users can also search for the weather of any place globally by entering the location in the search bar, and the app displays the relevant data, including:

1. Temperature: The current temperature in Celsius.
2. Humidity: The percentage of humidity in the air.
3. Wind Speed: The current wind speed in meters per second or meters per second.
4. Cloudiness: A percentage indicating the extent of cloud coverage.

** Tech Stack**
1. Frontend: JavaScript, HTML5, CSS3
2. API Integration: Weather data fetched using a weather API (e.g., OpenWeatherMap)
3. Geolocation API: Used to fetch the user's current location.

**Usage**
1. Open the app in any web browser. It will detect your current location and display the weather data.
2. Use the search bar to find weather information for any city or location worldwide.
3. The app will present details such as temperature, humidity, wind speed, and cloudiness in a neat and organized layout.
